# WeatherDashboard

Building a weather dashboard by retrieving data from another application's API showing the weather outlook for multiple cities


Task

Build a Weather Dashboard and obtain data from a third-party API

User story

I arrive at the website and there is a header called Weather Dashboard
I have a search bar with a clickable button where I can search for different cities
I then see a current weather container which details the current weather in the chosen city
I then see a 5 day forecast which is able to tell me what the next 5 days of weather look like in that city
The visuals are ok but I still need to add more script code to obtain the weather data
